        // Strings are immutable and arrays are mutable.
        const num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

        console.log(num[num.length - 1]);
        // In above it prints last element

        // Push Operation - inserst a new element at the end of the array
        console.log(num.push(10));
        console.log(num);

        //unshift - inserts element at the start of an array and returns new length of an array
        console.log(num.unshift(0));

        //pop
        console.log(num.pop());

        //shift

        const names = ["Meet", "Shreya", "Kabir", "Dev", "Poojan", "Sunny", "Kabir"];

        console.log(names.indexOf("Kabir", 2));

        //lastindexOf
        console.log(names.lastIndexOf("Kabir"));

        //splice() method
        const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
        const startIndex = 3;
        const amountToDelete = 1;
        numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
        console.log(numbers);
        //The second occurrence of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index. The numbers array would now be [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ].

        //slice() method
        //slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index).
        let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];
        let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
        console.log(todaysWeather);
        console.log(weatherConditions);

        //spread operator
        //ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...
        let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
        let thatArray = [...thisArray];
        //thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray.
        console.log(thisArray);
        console.log(thatArray);

        //Another huge advantage of the spread operator is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. 
        let thisArray1 = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];
        let thatArray1 = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];

        //indexOf(), that allows us to quickly and easily check for the presence of an element on an array.
        //indexOf() takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.


        //Problem
        //We have defined a function, filteredArray, which takes arr, a nested array, and elem as arguments, and returns a new array. elem represents an element that may or may not be present on one or more of the arrays nested within arr. Modify the function, using a for loop, to return a filtered version of the passed array such that any array nested within arr containing elem has been removed.
        function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
            let newArr = [];
            let flag = 0;
            // Only change code below this line
            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                flag = 0;
                for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
                    let index = arr[i].indexOf(elem);
                    if (index == -1) {
                        flag = 1;
                    }
                }
                if (flag == 1) {
                    newArr.push(arr[i]);
                }
            }

            // Only change code above this line
            return newArr;
        }

        console.log(filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 2], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3));
