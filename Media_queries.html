<!-- some advanced properties in css -->
<!-- for eg when we use img source and we want to convert that image into circle or triangle or any other shape of your choice with the help of clip-path property just search clip-path-generator on google you will get thousands of shapes and you can convert your image into your desired shape -->
<!-- box-sizing: content box; this property will not change the width and height of the content box border and padding will be outside the content box
box-sizing : border-box; this property will change the size of content box as it will decrease the size of content box to accumulate border and padding inside the content box  -->
<!-- Now to add responsiveness to our website we use media queries for setting the content according to the device width , height and resolutions,etc.  -->
<!-- So media queries are like if else statement that we use in our programming language
if there is mobile phone than set width according to its size,
if it is tablet than set width and height of content according to the tablet screen,
if it is wide screen computer than set width and height according to that wide screen computer. -->
<!-- search media query mdn on google  -->
