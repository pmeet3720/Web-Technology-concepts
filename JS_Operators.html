        // x = x ** y;

        // x = (5 == 5);

        //Strict equal operator

        //This is true only as both the data types are equal, both are integer only
        // console.log(x);

        // x = (5 === '5');
        //This will print false, as data type of both operand is not same.
        // console.log(x);

        // x = (5 !== '5');
        //Since operators are not equal so it will print true.
        // console.log(x);
